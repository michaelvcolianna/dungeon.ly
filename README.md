# Dungeon.ly

A work-in-progress helper for tabletop RPGs. Laravel 8.

The eventual real version probably won't use PHP/Laravel. This currently exists as a proof-of-concept for whether its features would be useful and mainly is being implemented by my friends and I.

### Current Features

- Account creation
- Profile photos
- Two-factor authentication
- Teams, implemented as games
- Dashboard with character listing
- Individual character sheets w/fast finding for fields (D&D only at the moment)

### Planned features

- Individual dice roller
- Dice roller linked to character sheet stats
- Combat tracker w/DM and player interfaces
- Map maker, allowing for uploading of map images & overlaying the graph + FOW (actual map builder like on Roll20/etc. might come later)
- Chat interface for entire game and for private in-game chats
- Individual adventure details (blog style?)
- Game/campaign notes for DM & players (blog style?)

I'll update this list as we play and add features/think of features to add.
